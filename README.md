This is my personal website made from scratch my myself. 

This project serves to advertise myself as a competitive software engineer candidate. 
Here I used HTML/CSS/JQuery, and Github pages to create and host the website.

If anyone would like to talk about how I implemented my website, I would love to talk about it.

Email me at pqcalvin@gmail.com if you are an employer or if you just want to chat!
